# DataMining
## Classifier 
This file uses the grades.csv file to do the Classifier analysis. I use the SK-Learn data analysis tool for python to do the analyses and compare the performance of each index in the code. 
## Clusters
This file uses the iris.data file to do the Cluster analysis. It receives 3 input arguments: name of the data set, number of clusters, output file name; in that order. 

It should look something like this: python clusters.py iris.data 3 output.txt
